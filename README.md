# Python Automatic File Sorter 🗂️

This is a Python automation script that organizes files in a selected folder into subfolders based on their file types — such as CSVs, images (`.jpg`), and text files.

## 💡 Features
- Uses `os` and `shutil` modules for directory management
- Automatically creates folders for each file type:
  - `csv files`
  - `image files`
  - `text files`
- Moves each file to the correct folder
- Handles files that do not match expected types
